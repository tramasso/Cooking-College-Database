This is a database project for a Cooking university. The database has data for Professors, 
Tutors, The Cooking course, Students and then it relates recipes and ingredients so 
professors and tutors know exactly what to do each day and how much of each ingredient they 
are going to use.
The project description is in portuguese and has a diagram to explain the relations.
