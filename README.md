This is a database project for a Database course.
It simulates a database for a college that has cooking courses.

The database has data for Professors, Tutors, courses, and Students.

It relates recipes, ingredients, and courses, so professors and tutors know exactly what to do each day and how much of each ingredient they are going to use.

The project description is in portuguese and has a diagram to explain the relations.
